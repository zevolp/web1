              <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">The allure of 8-bit and chiptune music to composers is not necessarily always a 
                function of nostalgia (although that certainly never hurts). To the musicians that work within the medium, there is a 
                charm and character to the limitations of emulated chip music.

                of even the first Castlevania installments: all of these are extraordinary compositions that abide by the strict limit of instrument channels 
                that the NES required.

          <h5>Why FamiTracker?</h5> 

Traditional MIDI-roll programs are rarely equipped to handle true NSF-style active 
tracking - their primary function is to arrange pre-recorded audio clips on a timeline. The 
complexity and nuances of these audio bites have grown dramatically over the years, but 
even advanced virtual instrument suites are not actively synthesising sounds.
<br><br>

This process of active synthesis is essential to the production of true, emulation-ready 
chiptune and 8-bit music. MIDI-roll tools are powerful, but they are fundamentally 
incompatible with this process. By contrast, 'tracker'-styled tools enable that live 
synthesizing from nearly any platform.
<br> <br>

Historically, 8-bit music was composed on proprietary software (or, for some of the oldest 
examples, partially drafted out on graph paper) by game designers. For a long time, 
composing with those lo-fi sounds was a restricted practice: first, to devices that already 
had the hardware necessary to read and produce the sounds, and second, to users who 
were able to hijack those devices in order to compose music on them. (This hijacking is 
not covered in the warranty.)
<br> <br>

Popular device choices are determined as much by their limitations as by their 
advantages. The Nintendo GameBoy Color and GameBoy Advanced have enjoyed 
exceptional popularity with composers as both conduits of emulation and for their 
distinctive, charming, and limited range of instrumentation.
<br> <br>

FamiTracker exists to bridge the gap between firmware emulation and users unable to
 acquire the tools required for that practice. There's no need to physically break open a 
vintage handheld console or to solder connections on a dusty sound board - 
FamiTracker, like other tracker applications, operates the same way that sound 
emulators do. 
<br><br>

Using FamiTracker doesn't mean you can't also circle back to the traditional hardware of 
chiptune and 8-bit hardware. This application has a built-in write function to generate 
NSF format filetypes. Chiptunes made in FamiTracker can be exported immediately in an 
NES-ready format.
